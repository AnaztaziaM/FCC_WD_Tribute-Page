<p id="tribute-info">Joaquin Rafael Phoenix (born October 28, 1974) is a Puerto Ricanâ€“born American actor, environmentalist, animal rights activist, and producer. He has received numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, and two Golden Globe Awards.</p>
  <h3>Awards and nominations</h3>  
  <p>Phoenix is the recipient of an <strong> Academy Award</strong>, a <strong>British Academy Film Award</strong>, a <strong>Grammy Award</strong>, two <strong>Golden Globe Awards</strong>, a Screen Actors Guild Award, the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival and the Award for Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival, among numerous other accolades from industry groups, critics' associations, and film festivals.</p>

<p>Joaquin and River hold the distinction of being the only brothers nominated for acting Academy Awards. Both Joaquin Phoenix and Heath Ledger won an Academy Award for their performances as the Joker, becoming the second pair of actors to win Academy Awards for playing the same character - the other pair being Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro, who won Best Actor and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor respectively, for their portrayals of Vito Corleone.</p>
  
  <h3> Activism</h3>
  <p>Phoenix has long been a social activist, lending his support to a number of <strong>charities and humanitarian organizations</strong>, such as Amnesty International, The Art of Elysium, HEART, and the Peace Alliance (which campaigns for a United States Department of Peace). Phoenix is also on the board of directors for The Lunchbox Fund, a non-profit organization which provides daily meals to students of township schools in Soweto, South Africa, which was founded by his ex-girlfriend, South African model Topaz Page-Green.</p>

  <p>Phoenix is a <strong>vegan</strong>, an <strong>animal rights advocate</strong> and a member of In Defense of Animals and PETA. He does not wear any clothes made out of animal skin. In his films, he requests that leather costumes be made from synthetic materials, however in a 2014 Playboy interview, he stated otherwise, saying that the boots in Walk the Line were "vintage". For his lifelong dedication to animal rights, he was named PETA's Person of the Year in 2019.</p>

<p>For Nation Earth he narrated Earthlings (2005), a documentary about <strong>humanity's economic dependence on animals</strong>. He was awarded the Humanitarian Award at the San Diego Film Festival in 2005, for his work and contribution to Earthlings. He narrated his second documentary for Nation Earth called Unity (2015), along with other celebrity vegans such as actress Jessica Chastain and comedian Ellen DeGeneres.</p>

<p>In 2017, he executive-produced the documentary <strong>What the Health</strong>, which premiered on June 16, 2017, on Netflix.</p>

  <p>On January 10, 2020, Phoenix <strong>was arrested</strong> with actress Jane Fonda at a <strong>climate change protest</strong> outside the United States Capitol at Washington, D.C. At the protest, Phoenix spoke about the link between animal agriculture and climate change. On February 2, 2020, after being awarded the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance in Joker, Phoenix lambasted the lack of diversity in the 2020 BAFTA nominations, as all of the nominees in the four main acting categories were white.</p>

<p>In February 2020, Phoenix starred in Guardians of Life, the first of twelve short films by the environmental organization Mobilize Earth that highlight the most pressing issues facing humanity and the natural world. Funds raised by the project will go to Amazon Watch and Extinction Rebellion. <strong>During his 2020 Oscar acceptance speech</strong>, he passionately promoted societal equality and animal rights, ending with a tribute to his brother, River Phoenix. This speech garnered acclaim and a backlash from the dairy industry.</p>

<p>Following the death of animal rights campaigner Regan Russell, who was killed by an animal transport lorry outside of a slaughterhouse in June 2020, Phoenix expressed his support by attending a vigil in Montreal, and writing a statement for People magazine.</p>
